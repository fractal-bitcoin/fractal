Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

Visit the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org) for more information.

For a ready-to-use binary version of the Bitcoin Core software, please visit [Bitcoin Core Downloads](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/).

What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. For more information,
see the [COPYING](COPYING) file or visit the [MIT License page](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The [Bitcoin Core GUI repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui) is used exclusively for
GUI development.Its master branch is identical across all monotree repositories.
Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork that repository
unless it is for development purposes.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review are critical bottlenecks in development; we receive more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
